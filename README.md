# **GhostBuds** (GB) is a private platform for organizing paranormal investigations
(*GhostBuds is a working title*)

This platform will utilize technology on the MERN stack in order to:
* Store a database of locations across the USA for paranormal investigations

* Allow team members to vote on their next location

* Allow teams to schedule their investigations together on a calender

* Give each member of the team directions to said location based off of their locations

* Allow team members to store their results in a private area to share with eachother and collaborate with (audio, video, images, etc.)

* Allow members to add their own locations to the database

* Give members the opportunity to build team profiles and individual profiles, but not necessarily for social media (unless they want to)


My goals with this platform are: 

* To give people outside the realm of paranormal studies a safe way in to experiencing the strange and unexplainable 

* To help budding investigative teams more easily organize their investigations

* To share and review data with eachother without needing to make it public

* **MOST IMPORTANTLY** to allow users to explore the paranormal without getting hindered by paywalls, public accounts, or other practices that exploit the user and their data

* To give investigators a single place to privately store their results and organize investigations without having to hop between multiple platforms online
